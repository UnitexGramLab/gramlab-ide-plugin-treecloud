# Unitex/GramLab IDE treeCloud plugin

> [Unitex/GramLab][unitexgramlab] is an open source, cross-platform, multilingual,
lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite

## NAME

TreeCloud is used to visualize the concordance in the form of a tree cloud, where branches reflect semantic distance between the words 

## SYNOPSIS

In order to visualize the concordance, be sure that the HTML-file "concord.html" is present. 

## INSTALLATION

To install this plugin you can download the latest `.zip` release from
[here](https://github.com/UnitexGramLab/gramlab-ide-plugin-treecloud/releases/latest)
and manually copy it to your `App/plugins` directory.

## DESCRIPTION

TreeCloud standalone application was originally developped by Philippe Gambette (). It was converted into GramLab plugin 
in order to build treecloud right in the GramLab. TreeCloud uses algorithm created by Philippe Gambette
to compute distances between the words. NeighborJoining algorithm (Saitou, Nei 1987) for computing the tree from distances and
EqualAngle algorithm for building the tree. The tree is renderred in SVG format using Apache Batik SVG Toolkit. You can export the tree into
several formats: Newick, SVG, PDF, JPEG. For more information please refer to the TreeCloud manual ().

## CAVEATS

The SVG picture is not dynamic, that is, there is not yet possibility to zoom or rotate the picture. Moreover, there is no possibility to drag the words
in case they are overlapping each other. These functionalities will be added in the next version. Stopwords can be removed only from trees built on English,
French, Spanish, Portuguese and German languages.
